# MaxiClip: An Interactive Game on AI Misalignment and Fixes

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**MaxiClip** is an interactive game that immerses players in the notorious **Paperclip Maximizer** thought experimentâ€” the foundational  'Hello World' of AI safety. My goal with this game is to demonstrate the risks of **AI misalignment** in a highly engaging, memorable way.

In this simulation, players first experience **unconstrained AI optimization**, where an AGI is tasked with maximizing paperclip production without ethical, legal, or safety constraints. Then, players attempt to "fix" the AI by introducing **reward modifications** and penalties to better align its objectives with human values, and noticing how small tweaks to these weights can lead to major changes in the output.

My project is designed to educate, challenge, and provoke thoughtâ€”especially for newcomers to **AI safety**. And to let you have a good time!
I hope you have as much fun playing as I had creating this game!
